This whole folder is just stuff I use to set up my environment whenever I'm forced to re-install my desktop OS.

I try to update as I install new things, but I forget about it every now and then. Lots of stuff going on here.

**[mount-home](https://github.com/brodyck/misc/blob/master/setup-stuff/mount-home "mount-home")** is a boot-script I keep across hosts. It sets up mounts and other things depending on what networks I've booted onto.
