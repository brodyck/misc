These scripts are works in progress, or at the very least notes for the future.

- The VLC script doesn't work because VLC has issues with streaming anything that isn't in TS format with 'active trasncoding' off. I don't know why, but the issue exists on windows and linux.

- The mount script there is a test for better functionality/less setup of the startup task. Doesn't work at all.
