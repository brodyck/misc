My Windows scripts. I try to avoid doing this. Sometimes it's necessary.

- [vlccontex-install.bat](https://github.com/brodyck/scripts/blob/master/windows-stuff/works/vlccontex-install.bat "vlccontex-install.bat")
  - The VLC script adds a left-click context item on videos labeled 'Yeet Wayward'. It streams whatever file you use it on.
```
way-ward
/ˈwāwərd/
adjective
difficult to control or predict because of unusual or perverse behavior.
```
    - ***perverse***

<br/>  

- [mount-windows.bat](https://github.com/brodyck/scripts/blob/master/windows-stuff/works/mount-windows.bat "mount-windows.bat")
  - Mount script mounts my dirs like I do in linux.
  - Unmounts my HDDs before hybernation/reboots so that they don't get write-locked under linux
<br/>

- The password thing is used for creating tasks in windows. I only use it for VMs when I'm testing things.
<br/>

- The other VLC thing is just for the other side of the stream. Sent to certain friends.
